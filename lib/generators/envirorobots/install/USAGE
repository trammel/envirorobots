Description:
    Installs the envirorobots engine by adding a new route and placing development and production robots.txt files into place.

Example:
    rails generate envirorobots:install

    This will move:
        public/robots.txt to config/envirorobots/production.robots.txt

    This will create:
        config/envirorobots/development.robots.txt
        config/envirorobots/production.robots.txt

    This will be added to your config/routes.rb:
        mount Envirorobots::Engine => '/'
